This project involved the comprehensive renovation of a master bathroom in a suburban home, aiming to create a modern, spa-like retreat. The client desired a minimalist aesthetic with clean lines, high-end finishes, and smart technology integration.

We began by reconfiguring the layout to optimize space and flow, relocating the shower and vanity areas. Large-format porcelain tiles were selected for both the floor and shower walls, providing a seamless and expansive feel. A custom-built floating double vanity with a sleek quartz countertop was installed, offering ample storage and a contemporary look. The shower was transformed into a spacious wet room with a frameless glass enclosure, complete with a rainfall shower head and integrated body jets for a luxurious bathing experience. Underfloor heating was installed for added comfort, and all lighting was upgraded to energy-efficient recessed LEDs, complemented by a heated towel rail.

The project emphasized smart solutions, including a smart toilet with bidet functionality and integrated storage solutions to maintain the minimalist design. The result is a stunning, highly functional master bathroom that serves as a tranquil sanctuary for the homeowners.

The design focused on creating a serene atmosphere, beginning with the installation of exquisite Italian marble on all floor and wall surfaces. A custom-built steam shower, complete with aromatherapy and multiple body jets, became a central feature. Adjacent to it, a stunning freestanding jetted bathtub was positioned to offer a focal point for relaxation. Underfoot, natural stone flooring was installed with an integrated heating system for year-round comfort.

Smart technology played a key role, with an integrated lighting system offering chromotherapy options and a hidden sound system providing ambient music. A bespoke double vanity, crafted from premium wood and topped with matching marble, provided ample space and storage. Every detail, from the designer fixtures to the heated towel warmer, was carefully selected to contribute to the opulent spa experience.

This project tackled the challenge of transforming a small, outdated bathroom in a city apartment into a bright, modern, and highly functional space. The primary goal was to maximize the perception of space and improve usability without expanding the room\'s footprint.

We started by replacing the bulky traditional vanity with a sleek, compact wall-mounted unit that included an integrated sink, freeing up valuable floor space. A wall-mounted toilet was installed, further enhancing the open feel and making cleaning easier. For the shower, a custom corner unit with a clear glass enclosure was chosen to fit snugly into the available space, providing a comfortable showering area without overwhelming the room. Large format, light-colored porcelain tiles were used on both the floor and walls to create a seamless look and reflect light, making the room appear larger.

Strategic lighting was crucial; recessed LED lights were installed to provide ample illumination without visual clutter. A large mirror, extending across the vanity, was chosen to reflect light and expand the room visually, and it included hidden storage. To save space at the entrance, a stylish sliding barn door was fitted. The overall design focused on clean lines, bright colors, and smart storage solutions, resulting in a small bathroom that feels surprisingly spacious and inviting.

This project focused on transforming an existing bathroom into a fully accessible space, ensuring safety, comfort, and independence for a homeowner with mobility needs. The design prioritized universal design principles, making the bathroom functional for all users.

The most significant modification was the installation of a roll-in shower with a zero-threshold entry, eliminating any barriers for wheelchair access. A durable, fold-down shower seat was integrated, along with multiple ADA-compliant grab bars strategically placed within the shower and around the toilet area. The toilet was replaced with a comfort-height model for easier use. Non-slip porcelain tiles were installed throughout the bathroom to prevent falls, even when wet.

A custom-built vanity with an open knee space was designed to allow for wheelchair access, and all faucets were replaced with easy-to-operate lever handles. A handheld shower head was installed for added convenience. Where necessary, the doorway was widened to accommodate a wheelchair. All wall areas where grab bars were installed or might be installed in the future were reinforced with blocking to ensure maximum security. The result is a beautifully designed, highly functional, and safe bathroom that enhances the homeowner\'s quality of life.

Solid surface countertops were selected for their seamless finish and resistance to stains and bacteria. To promote hygiene and reduce water consumption, all faucets and soap dispensers were sensor-activated, and toilets were replaced with water-efficient models featuring automatic flush mechanisms.

Stainless steel fixtures were used throughout for their longevity and sleek, professional look. High-efficiency hand dryers were installed to minimize waste. Custom-designed commercial-grade vanity units provided ample space and integrated waste disposal. The lighting was upgraded to bright, energy-efficient LED panels, ensuring excellent illumination. Anti-slip flooring was a critical safety feature, and robust partition systems were installed for privacy and durability. The result is a series of modern, highly functional, and low-maintenance commercial washrooms that meet the highest standards of cleanliness and design.

A distressed wood vanity with open shelving was custom-built, providing a rustic yet elegant focal point and ample storage for towels and decorative items. A light quartz countertop complemented the vanity perfectly.

The shower floor was laid with pebble-look tiles, offering a tactile connection to the beach. A freestanding clawfoot tub was installed for a touch of vintage elegance and relaxation, though a walk-in shower with clear glass could also fit the aesthetic. Brushed nickel fixtures were selected to complete the look. Nautical-themed lighting, such as lantern-style sconces, and subtle rope and driftwood accents were incorporated to enhance the coastal theme. A large round mirror, reminiscent of a ship\'s porthole, was mounted above the vanity. The result is a tranquil and inviting coastal-style bathroom that feels like a permanent vacation.

This project involved the design and installation of a minimalist wet room, transforming a conventional bathroom into an open, seamless, and highly functional space. The client desired a contemporary aesthetic with clean lines and an uncluttered feel.

The core of the wet room design was the use of large-format concrete-effect porcelain tiles applied consistently across both the floor and walls, creating a continuous, monolithic look. A linear shower drain was seamlessly integrated into the floor, ensuring efficient water runoff without disrupting the visual flow. A recessed shower niche was built into the wall for discreet storage of toiletries.

To maintain the minimalist aesthetic, a wall-mounted toilet and bidet were installed, freeing up floor space and simplifying cleaning. A sleek floating vanity with an integrated sink was chosen, further contributing to the open feel. All fixtures were selected in a minimalist black finish to provide a striking contrast against the light grey tiles. Integrated LED strip lighting was used to create subtle illumination and highlight the architectural features of the room. Underfloor heating was installed for comfort, and a robust waterproof membrane system was applied beneath all surfaces to ensure complete water containment. An optional frameless glass screen was installed to define the shower area without visually closing off the space. The result is a sophisticated, easy-to-maintain wet room that embodies modern minimalism and offers a luxurious showering experience.
